# [Code Translation Service](https://translation-algorithm--jacob-griffin.repl.co/)
Translates code from one programming language to another. Due to the intended scal of this project, only a few programming languages were selected, and only the essential features of each language were accounted for. Though this project is a web application, I intentionally omitted a server-side language to make it as accessible as possible for download and editing, and potentially for a desktop application.

### Current Support
Though somewhat limited:
- C++ to Python
- Java to C++
- Java to Python
- All languages to themselves

### Support "in progress"

Java to English*

*Started, but currently shelved

### Planned support
All translations between Java, C++ and Python

Potentially an English output

## SMOL Filetype
As a basis for this project, I developed a filetype that reads as a list of regular expression commands, complete with control structures and comments. To facilitate making my translation tables, I also developed an [editor](https://translation-algorithm--jacob-griffin.repl.co/editor) for these files. To learn more, visit the [specification](https://translation-algorithm--jacob-griffin.repl.co/smol-spec).

## Services used
This project uses the ACE code editor, Bootstrap and Google Fonts, and it was developed on Repl.it
