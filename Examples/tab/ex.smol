#!title:Tab Example

# Tab tabulates each line of the selection

tab /{[^\x05]+}/ #Tabs everything between the curly braces. 

#[^\x05] is used instead of . because firefox doesn't support dotall (s). \x05 is a system character that cannot be typed normally

tab /<li>.+<\/li>/g #individually selects list items and adds a tab
